# 🔗 PlaceholdURL – Fill Dynamic URLs with One Click

PlaceholdURL is a smart, privacy-respecting Chrome extension that lets you fill URLs with dynamic segments

Whether you’re navigating to a customer dashboard, testing a user account, or accessing parameterized tools,
PlaceholdURL saves you from editing URLs by hand. Just click a bookmark, enter your values, and go.

## 🧠 What It Does

PlaceholdURL detects placeholders in your bookmarked URLs using the format:

```
{{placeholder-name}}
```

When you click a URL like:

```
https://dashboard.example.com/user/{{userId}}?env={{environment}}
```

A popup asks you to fill in userId and environment. Once entered, you’re automatically taken to the complete, resolved
URL.

This makes PlaceholdURL ideal for users who frequently access dynamic links — from developers and testers to analysts,
support staff, and operations teams.

## 🚀 Key Features

## 💡 Use Cases

PlaceholdURL is built to support a variety of workflows, including:

- Opening dashboards with user- or project-specific paths
- Accessing tools or environments by entering team, region, or date
- Testing variations of URLs without managing dozens of bookmarks
- Navigating complex internal systems using a single smart link

Whether you’re working with staging environments, customer lookups, team dashboards, or anything in between —
PlaceholdURL saves time and reduces errors.

## 📦 Example Bookmark Templates

 Customer    | Dashboard | https://app.example.com/user/{{userId}}                     
 Log         | Search    | 	https://logs.example.com/query?email={{userEmail}}         
 Environment | Switch    | 	https://tools.example.com/deploy/{{environment}}/{{build}}
